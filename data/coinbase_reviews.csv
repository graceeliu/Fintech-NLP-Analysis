We are happy that you have a good experience with our app.', 'modified': '2021-10-14T06:27:27Z'}",I am impressed by how easy this app is to use.  There is endless amounts of information about cryptocurrency on Coinbase and if it is t there u can be connected to it.  I had been weary about crypto but when I heard about Coinbase I was originally in getting shares of it when it went public.  When I was unable to get the stock and it went through the roof right off like had figured we’ll that is when I decided to download and check it out.  Coinbase gave me a small amount for down loading the app and then through the learn and earn feature I was able to learn what crypto is and does but also get like four different currencies.  The ease of operation of the app made it very i intimidating and I continued to learn about crypto amd now I’m trading almost daily.  I also had some support issues with my Coinbase card and they were quickly replied to and I was given some basic help which was unable to solve the problem but they sent my issue up the support chain and my Coinbase card was fully operational the next morning.  I say thank you to Coinbase for making it easy for me to learn and operate trading with crypto currency’s because it has been easy making money.,5,False,Easy money !,dank0116

We’ll pass along your suggestions to the team as we continue to improve the app.\n\nRegarding the bank linking issue, we understand your concern with Plaid, and your feedback is valid. We’re always working to offer more flexibility and security when connecting bank accounts, and we appreciate your patience as we work through these challenges.\n\nThanks again for sharing your thoughts, and we’ll keep working to improve your experience!', 'modified': '2025-01-24T22:31:15Z'}","Really good app for crypto beginners and intermediate users. But I wish the integration of Coinbase advanced/basic side was better. One example is the alerts, why can’t I just set custom price alerts while on Coinbase advanced? That would save a lot of time. Same thing with checking my staking rewards and coins, why can’t I check these in advanced also? I have to switch advanced off to do these things. It really should be on both sides of the app. One real big complaint I have and issue I have found many other people have is the ability to link your bank account without using plaid. This is a big red flag for me. It used to work very long ago but at some point was made basically useless. The manual linking will still show up but it never actually works. No matter what bank you have. Coinbase support will just push you to use plaid which is just very weird when linking a bank account manually is the industry standard. This also is the case on desktop, not just the app. I do not want to use plaid and give my bank login to a third party regardless of how safe you guys say it is. Other than these three things I mentioned the app is nice, clean and works well. But I really wish these updates/fixes were implemented.

I signed up for the Coinbase one membership to get rid of all the hydrating fees they charge and it does help though they’re still hidden fees every time we buy trading something in the “spread” so be aware of that even though it says zero fees are still paying $.10-$.50 per trade.  They may randomly just lock your account with no explanation and then if you ask for a refund on anything and your account locked, never funded and crypto so it’s still locked. They still have your money so they never give your money back. I have currently been locked out of my account since the day before my birthday so about two weeks now I have spent roughly 8 hours on the phone with Customer Service to try to find out why I get the same party line every time that the system didn’t like something OK so go in and freaking change it that’s why you have humans working there, but on the upside, that’s how I discovered using Robin Hood much cheaper much more friendly service much quicker and easier.

I’m giving only 3 stars because there’s basic fundamentals that should be in any type of “investing/trading” app. For example how much money a person (CURRENTLY) has invested in Coinbase. Example: Cost Basis for your Coinbase portfolio and for each individual crypto that a person buys. You should also be able to see your cost basis for each individual crypto you’re currently invested in. I think the “All time returns” is confusing and makes trying to figure out how much you’ve gained on different trades all the more confusing. Especially when you go to my assets a click on the crypto you’re currently invested in the only info you get is your total returns. Meaning if you bought and sold a crypto over a year ago and then bought the same crypto a year later it just adds all your gains together therefore you cannot tell how much you’re up for that current trade. I think Coinbase needs to seriously invest their time in fixing the fundamentals as they make it extremely confusing to understand how much you actually have invested in each crypto.

Then a few months later they wanted you to transfer it to a Coinbase wallet because they didn’t want any responsibility for it. Ok I transferred it there so I do see it.

However, there is one thing that I think Coinbase should improve on: the user interface for iPad Pro tablet/keyboard. I use my iPad Pro as my main computer, and I find that the app does not fit well on the screen. The interface is the wrong aspect ratio, so there is a lot of blank space on the sides. This makes the app look less appealing and wastes valuable screen real estate. I wish Coinbase would optimize the app for iPad Pro users, and make it more responsive and adaptive to different screen sizes and orientations.

They show you the list price, but when you review your purchase before submitting it, they actually charge you a higher price/coin on top of their transaction fee. It’s the same thing with selling.

Even after a transaction to buy crypto clears with your bank, they call it “pending” so they can hold it for the full 7 days. Any time a bank doesn’t let you access your own funds, it’s either security or it’s because they want to make money off your money. The longer it’s with them, the more they can make. Then, when you do want to move some money, they charge you super high fees to do it. Crypto is such a friggin’ scam. Not as bad as NFT’s, but still … it’s going to be a long time before crypto is actually worth it to most people, which is why it’s also so volatile and even a huge group of celebrities and investors can get scammed out of millions, like with FTX. Coinbase is just another company making money hand over fist without providing good support to customers or offering decent fees.

You can only contact via email which takes days for them to reply and most times its a automated response.

If you’re having issues with staking certain crypto currencies then good luck on getting them fixed because I am still unable to stake. They claim my account is unverified but yet I have went through the verification process numerous times and even have level 3 (highest level) verification on my account. I have tried contacting on social media and have gotten nowhere. I have tried callihg but can’t even get to speak to a person because they only will deal with account compromises over the phone which is a total load of crap.

I recently took a couple months off trading but woke up one morning to a call from my bank that Coinbase was attempting to withdraw $5,000 from my account. An action I certainly did not initiate as I was well aware I had less than $10 in the bank.
I contacted Coinbase immediately and notified them that my account had been hacked. Yet somehow they had instantly credited my crypto account for the $5,000 and then allowed it to be sent somewhere. Now I have never been able to send or withdraw funds until they cleared the bank but I guess the hacker just had the special touch.
Two months went by and I still hadn’t heard from Coinbase, so I reached out to them again. At which time they inform me that my account is locked until I pay for the missing funds! Their reasoning is that I somehow allowed my account to be hacked. Well the way I see it the most logical explanation given the turn of events is that it was hacked from within Coinbase itself.

Coinbase, unlike other apps, charges a high fee for clients to store and secure funds in Coinbase crypto wallets. You'll also pay a market buy/sell price that's substantially more than the actual price of the coin you're buying. For example, if you buy a $1000 coin with $1000 in cash, you will receive about $900 of the coin you just bought. Coinbase charges you a high fee for holding and securing your cryptocurrency once you're ready to sell (regardless if it was for a minute or a year). Furthermore, you will receive a market buy/sell price that is far lower than the actual price of the coin you are selling. For example, if you sell the same crypto you just bought for $1000 and only got $900 in crypto, you'll earn roughly $800 in fiat. This is robbery in broad daylight, in my opinion. 

When you trade or exchange Cryptos with other Cryptos, it gets even worse. Because there is no easy way to contact these crooks, their customer service is non-existent.

One of the things that first off I noticed they do not offer a grace period for their fees like many of the other apps will offer 30 days without fees but this app does not do that.
Also the app does not make it easy to see what’s been invested in the track your investments by cryptocurrency‘s you actually have to click into each cryptocurrency individually to see what you purchase them at and where the current values that so it’s not easy to track your overall investment portfolio performance.
Lastly there’s no a crypto wallet or earn potential within the app you have to download a different app for that and also they list all the crypto currencies but you have to sort to “tradable” because all the cryptocurrency’s that are listed are not tradeable  in this app so it’s kind of misleading until you go to the “tradable tab” and then you can see which cryptocurrency’s or actually available to be purchased through this app.

This app is more ideal for HODLing, but I make some trades here and there as things go up and down. I’ve tried other apps and didn’t like the UI or just didn’t trust them.

I deposited $3k through ACH from my bank on Feb 9th, 2021. Zero balance shown in Coinbase and Coinbase Pro ever since. Oddly, my account history in Coinbase reflects a $3k USD transfer to Coinbase Pro (which I didn’t initiate) but such transfer does not exist in my Coinbase Pro account.

I understand the heavy interest in crypto has bogged down support, which I have sympathy for. Expecting customers to sit on their hands for 30+ days without any response is unethical and morally demeaning. 

If you are reading this review to see if you should be downloading the Coinbase app, please do not do it. Look elsewhere.

The crypto industry is still emerging. Coinbase should follow the customer priority model of Gemini. When I had a customer support issue with Gemini’s new app back in 2018, not only did I get quick 2hr email response detailing the probable cause but I also received a conference call minutes later from the dev team inquiring the steps leading up to the issue so it didn’t happen to anyone else.

Gives easy access to cryptocurrency trading. 
“Instant” deposits. (More on this below.)
App is user friendly and simple. 

CONS:
Gives easy access to cryptocurrency trading. 
Instant deposits allow purchases, positive cash flow is needed for high frequency trading. (Duh)
App is way too simple. Even Pro is too limited. We need far more functionality and features. Tracking data of trades etc etc. Charts need improvement. Other Apps should not rival a Billion dollar company in tracking cryptocurrency. You need better CS. Use TDA as your model, not RbnHd.
It should be more clear when funds have cleared the bank, and when cryptocurrency becomes transferable. The Portfolio should only have assets managed in list form. A ”Coin List” can show all coins available, tradable, etc, and a Watchlist are in dire need of inclusion. I also don’t understand the multiple app approach. Account privilege status should be set up in an account hierarchy that grants access to higher levels within the App, not split up into separate Apps. 

Over all great experience so far. Reliable yet limited, but does what it does well. Let your deposits clear before you transfer coin. Know the limitations and pray for updates.

Right away I began trading and everything was very easy to navigate. The platform is visually pleasing, easy to use and get started, and also offers a wide selection of coins to trade from. 

My only complaint is that there is no (easy) way to see how much I’ve gained or lost since the time of purchase. What I mean by this is that on other trading apps when you buy a coin/stock you are able to immediately see how much the value has increased or decreased which gives you a good indication of when to sell and how to track gains and losses. 

Unless I am mistaken, the Coinbase app doesn’t offer this feature. You can see the current price of the asset and how much it has gone up within a specific time frame and your current balance in local currency as well as the conversion amount (e.g. 
         $512
          0.01 BTC
)

I would really like to see Coinbase add another drop down option on the “Your Assets” page that shows exactly how much the value of each asset has changed since the original purchase as well as its current value. 

(E.g.
 
Bitcoin           $50,000   <— current price
                     +$1,000     <— change in value since time of purchase

Before… the Empire. We have come a long way since the 1970s, and so has our money. The US dollar is not money. It is a debt based currency that the “Federal” Reserve has practically printed into extinction. Many Crypto currencies on the other hand, meet the definition of “money,” just as gold and other items that store value. 

Coinbase is very user friendly. Especially for GenX. While it took some time to learn how to use it, CoinBase offered “free” cyrpto as an incentive. Once I was on the exchange, I discovered that it is easy to buy and sell tokens, send them to any of my private wallets, or despots my earnings as USD back into my bank acct. 

A couple of things I want to note. 
Coinbase is compliant with all state and federal regulations, and keep a track record for your CPA. 
Coinbase offers incentives to hold your money by staking tokens such as Solana, Ethereum, and even USDC, and the APR is much better than any bank I know of currently operating in the US. 
While I have had my technological challenges, their customer service has been very helpful in helping me resolve them in a timely manner.

Tips:

Don’t store the bulk of your crypto on any exchange. Not your keys, not your crypto is real

Figure out what you want, what wallets support it, and do the research on a good cold storage setup

Factory direct is the only “safe” way to purchase a cold storage wallet. Inspect all packaging and devices for any irregularities. If sus, arrange a return/exchange

Find a good hot wallet (internet wallet) and keep a small/medium bag there for quick trades, purchases, and cash outs

Follow your wallets, exchanges, crypto projects, regulatory agencies, & current heads of state/agency on social media

Check your bags often

Coinbase is so much more than just a simple exchange though.  It offers individualized charts of your portfolio including charts of individual currencies and up-to-date pricing charts for many popular currencies.

It also keeps you updated on the latest news articles from authoritative sources updated on an hourly basis.  Coinbase charges fees scaled on the amount of cash you spend and allows you to use PayPal.  I usually buy $26 allotments of currency at a fee of $1.49.  You can buy up to $50 for $1.99.  So the more you spend the less you pay in fees but I am simply an enthusiast.

I see the potential of crypto currency and want a piece of it.  I dabble with it at the moment to see how I do and then down the road who knows.  I never ever invest money I can’t afford to lose, so no harm to me if the bottom falls out of the market however disappointing that may be.

First and foremost is while monitoring ETH I “traded” at 1395, selling 5 ETH for USD. On the sales report it said the trade price was $1381 A 14$ DIFFERENCE! I sit there and refresh the price constantly, and it hadn’t been $1381 for at least 5 minutes. So getting jilted out of $14 x 5 coins plus their high fees ate up almost 20% of my trade. Thats after fees just to buy coins too. Not very impressed and kind of sketchy if you ask me. 

Next is an interface issue. When you want to put your USD$ back into your linked bank acct you have to select the “withdraw” option instead of the “deposit” option. You are withdrawing the cash from the app acct back into your bank acct and a deposit pulls money out of your bank and deposits it into your app acct. This unclear wording made me nearly overdraw and even worse, since it takes my bank a few days to process the transaction (both withdraw and deposit), I had no access to my money for over a week which was frustrating. 

Another issue is the fees themselves. Very high if you’re trying to do times trades. 

Last issue off the top of my head is the lack of Monero trading.

3. This is unlikely to be noticed unless something like what I described in number 2 happens, so they can scam everyone on the app if something really did happen.

Coinbase Pro was so good when it came to looking at charts or placing orders. 

However, this app is a trash, here is why:

1. I literally had to search where and how to add funds. Was the UX designer intern and not FTE ? Did you guys do any usability studies? Give this app to 100 random people and see how many can figure out how to add funds in first minute.

2. The charts are messed up no matter you use candle or lines. Once you pinch to adjust x axis or y axis, it gets messed up and makes it impossible to read. 

3. The order entry mechanism has been made unnecessarily complex. You have to use the back arrow to change the default price. 

4. There is a lot of self promotion going on on the ‘asset’ tab. I want to see my assets, period. Don’t waste the real estate there with some fluff stuff.

The instant transfer option isn’t instant. So if it doesn’t go through — say if you don’t have enough money to cover the withdrawal — Coinbase will prevent you from conducting transactions and inform you that you owe them for the purchase of the cryptocurrency. 

The kicker is that you can’t pay them back with a debit card; it has to be through a bank and connected through Plaid which supports mostly traditional institutions such as Bank of America, Chase, etc. 

I don’t have and do not want traditional banking. So I’m basically punished for it by the website and app.

Wow, where do I start!? 

I’ve been using this app ‘from day one son!”. Yes, day ☝️. I absolutely love it, and recommend all users, especially ‘newbs’,  (new people to crypto) to use this route when purchasing cryptocurrency! 

It’s super simple and easy to use. This app is without a doubt the most intuitive, no B/S, straight to the point way to get started with crypto. 

I am very well versed when it comes to tech and the UX (User Experience), as I develop massive interfaces for entire buildings, commercial, residential, and business, home automation systems. I’ve made user interfaces for every type of system you can think of. What I’m saying is, the UX plays a major part of an apps ‘make it or break it’ Philosophy. If an app is to difficult to navigate, it can break a company. Well this app definitely meets, and exceeds, this.

For example, there is information present on your web-based account that isn’t in the app (like when the cryto currency you bought is actually going to show up in your account...I had no clue it would take a week from purchase to actually see the currency hit your wallet). There are also limited discretionary warnings to inform you of such issues (given my previous example, the little as ‘30 minutes’ before your wallet updates is just not true). 

Lastly, you can’t actually access support from the app. It sends you to the website, make you log in again, somehow make you log in one more time and then finally you can talk to a bot that really isn’t all that helpful. Also, if you log out of the app, upon logging on again, you have to set everything again (passcodes, price alarms) forcing you to constantly have the app going in the background. 

My overall opinion, what’s the point of having an app, outside of spot checking prices...which some will argue you should not be CONSTANTLY checking anyhow, if it has far less usability than the website?

I sent another message showing that my window had expired and asked for my transaction fee to be returned- no response. 
Fortunately the 3rd party receiving the btc returned them (charging me another fee) was charged $25 to send two small amounts and then $15 for them to be returned... all because this app couldn’t complete my transaction and the “customer support” didn’t think my issue was worthy of their time. 
I respectfully asked for the company to make it right and at least refund my transaction fees on their end- no response.

Not to mention just to make trading worth while, you must make over 5% in equity because 2% will always go to them for buying and an additional 2-5% or more to them when they sell your cryptocurrency for a much lower value than the actual value. For example, BTC will be valued at $15,900 and they will sell your BTC to you for $15,500 and keep the $400 value in BTC for themselves. That's another 3% they are taking!!!

About a week and a half after I initially purchased, bitcoin began declining extremely rapidly. I tried to sell, as I had made a pretty good profit.

But as it turns out, Coinbase STILL HADN’T PROCESSED MY TRANSACTION. It said it was still “pending” because I used a bank account, not a card. It won’t let me sell.

The very nature of the bitcoin market is that it’s a short term investment. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason it should take Coinbase 10 business days to process a transaction. At this rate, there’s a good chance I will lose over $300. 

Last thing: When you buy bitcoin, the price is always automatically inflated about 3% higher from what the graph represents.

Coinbase is run by Brian Armstrong with funding from Digital Currency Group, run by Barry Silbert.  This is important because it's a wallet and you need to trust your provider.

The app is linked to a more full featured website.  Very easy to buy, sell, and send coin to friends.  Also, has a Vault feature which is used to store larger balances more cryptographically secure through multi-signature access provides much needed  sleep at night comfort.

The company has a history of making sound announcements; especially when volume spikes and trading is impossible globally...and this does happen.

They were also leaders during the Ethereum split and most recently during the birth of bitcoin cash.

2. No ability to see the total gain or loss of individual cryptocurrency. It’s very annoying to have to look at each one to see how much I’ve gained or lost by looking at the difference
Between the amount I spent and the value now.  I think that could be streamlined and it would benefit this app greatly.  I would like to see it almost copy Robinhoods design for their “Investing” Tab.

I’m talking full sign in, not enter my PIN or use FACE ID—however, speaking of entering a PIN and FACE ID, I’m noticing now that when I boot up the app I’m prompted to enter my PIN, even though I have my settings to use my FACE ID instead.

Now for the REALLY ugly: They blocked my trades when I tried to move to a different currency near the apex of a 2x surge. Ive also had it happen on smaller rising trends as well. Guess what...they ALSO blocked my trades on the down slope. So I was forced to ride it up and then back down, to 25% below what I started with.

Feels scammy. I’m going to cash out before they take all of my capital. All in all, after gaining about 20% on my capital in a few days, all but 1% which I get to keep is going to them due to fees.

This helps you track how much you have spent on a coin, and determine where the profit line is. However, this featured does not seem very accurate. Robinhood has the sharpest average cost feature I’ve seen.

3. Coinbase is extremely judicious with the coins they offer. They have high standards and I trust the coins they list. They have delisted coins when their teams don’t meet a standard. I have a lot of faith in CB for this reason.

4. It is finally very clear how to suspend automatic buys. Initially, they made it very easy to set it up, but very hard to discontinue. It is now as easy to suspend as it is to set it up.

1). I like the simple charting interface to watch your portfolio grow. 
2). Offers a good amount of cryptocurrencies to buy.
3). Earn free crypto for learning about different cryptocurrencies. 
4). Instant buying power while funds settle. 

Cons:
1). The simple charting interface becomes WAY to simple! It would be nice to have pie charts or other graphs to track the growth of my investments next to my purchases. 
2). You can only place market orders, no limit orders. 
3). Zero charting besides a dull line graph. No candles, drawing, or any other tools. 
4). No crypto news section. 
5). Overall just too simple. 

To offset some of these cons I downloaded Coinbase Pro and moved all my funds over there. This was to be a mistake. It was overly complicated to move the funds and once they hit CBP, all my buying history was gone. Example: let’s say I had eight purchases of BTC of $25 each. Once transferred into CBP all of those instances became one deposit $200, which stinks.

I’m writing sideways.  It is hard to believe the founder of Coinbase, who’s suppose to be supremely tech savvy, would have such an antiquated app and interface. I’m typing sideways. The app was written for first generation smart phones, and the screen looks like such. It remains locked in a bulky, truncated portrait mode. You may not orient your device horizontally.   

The graphs are by far the worst I’ve ever seen. There are zero units of measurement, neither on the vertical scale, nor the horizontal. Thus you can not visually gauge price vs. time.  You must go to another app to view graphs. 

That being said, the app is superb for educating neophytes on what’s out there, an excellent educational tool. 

One of the most egregious flaws is that you can’t read the transaction at the bottom of the screen because it’s blocked with a thick, opaque huge horizontal blue bar that says “TRADE”.  You cannot decline it, minimize it, or make it go away.  It completely covers your first trade, and you simply cannot view the transaction.  A can of bug spray should come with this app.

With the cryptocraze boom over the last year, I’ve noticed a marked change with Coinbase, unfortunately not for the better. Fees are ridiiiiiculously high when sending my BTC to another address, and it takes longer for transactions to go through. 

It’s not uncommon for the app to crash/not load/disable buys/sells during high traffic days when there’s a lot of movement in the market, which makes for a frustrating experience. 

January 2017 – original review

Coinbase has come a long way since early 2014. After buying BTC and sending it to my old Hive wallet, and pretty much forgetting about it the past 3 years, I was alarmed to find out my old Hive wallet was no longer a thing (I don't recall keeping BTC in the same place where you bought them being proper back then). But now Coinbase is one of the most respected 1-stop shops for managing BTC. It took about 15min longer than the stated 30 for my BTC transfer to be confirmed, but the app is simple and beautiful to work with. Love the price alerts I can set up—just a really attractive and functional interface. Well done!",4,False,UPDATED | RE: Love the app!,SandrasLibrary

2018-04-17 23:06:06,,"***Note to all users: AVOID transferring money between digital wallets within Coinbase, it is a trap and your money will end up “in the cloud” as customer service liked to call it.

First off I’d like to say that coin base is an excellent platform for beginners that would like to invest their money into digital Currencies. Simple, easy to use and the customer service is friendly:)

With that being said, the reason for the 1star review is because I lost a fair amount of money for transferring funds from my litecoin digital wallet to my bitcoin digital wallet.

HERE’S ALL I DID: Using the url given to my account SPECIFICALLY for my bitcoin digital wallet, I sent money from my litecoin wallet to that address. Few moments later, the transaction status said complete... Although there was no money that ended up in my bitcoin wallet, but of course the money was taken from my litecoin wallet.

I spoke with customer service and her explanation for what happened was that the money just ended up in the cloud and that there was nothing I could do, the money was lost.

So pretty much that method of transferring funds is a trap to take your money with no reimbursement.

On Coinbase, you get real crypto- not like on robinhood or SoFi, but remember that nobody should ever ever ever keep their crypto on any exchange or hot wallet. Sure, Coinbase has good security they say, but keeping crypto in Coinbase or Coinbase wallet is extremely stupid and will be very sad when it disappears. 

Everyone should have Coinbase but use it for as few transactions as possible and keep your crypto in an air-gapped hardware wallet. The big institutions (such as Coinbase) don’t want you to use truly safe cold storage because then they can’t enjoy all the custodial perks. 

There is one very good thing about Coinbase: the debit card. It should be used as little as possible (enormous transaction fees), but it is the only way you can get instant spending power or paper cash from your crypto rather than having to wait for the clearing periods between banks.",3,False,Coinbase let’s us “explore the world of defi” lol,ravenb2021

There is no link anywhere on the website that allows people to contact them if your issue is not in their database and/or their recommendation does not work. So be careful. I surely would not want to have any money tied up with a company that does not at least have email support and I can’t imagine the problems that would come if someone did have a lot of money in their accounts with no one to speak too.

This structure is designed to increase the depth and liquidity of the markets.\n\nAdditionally, network fees, which are determined by the demand on the Ethereum network, can also contribute to higher costs during times of congestion.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback and will pass it along to the relevant team.

For example if you buy something like xrp and the price is 2.50 you’re going to pay an insane spread. Looking at around 2.55+ per share plus a fee. So you’re already starting out way in the red because of the high spread fee. The market doesn’t fluctuate by 5 cents a share so I’m not sure why they charge so much. And they don’t return the difference they keep it. I understand they’re running a business but I think it’s a bit ridiculous to charge such a high spread on top of fees.

My Coinbase card was compromised and used for several hundred dollars. I called to let them know several minutes after and was told they couldn’t do anything until the transaction completes.
